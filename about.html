            <p> I am currently at Capitec Bank as an employee and was lucky to receive the learnership for Java programming.
                I have been pursuing a degree in Mathematics and Statistics while receiving this opportunity to do programming.
                My goal is to obtain this learnership qualification and go back to complete my degree,
                to become a Data Scientist.
            </p><br>
            <p>I have been working at Capitec Bank for many years and gained experience in Leadership as I was the Team Leader
                for 9 years. However, I never felt fulfillment and decided to pursue other business areas while developing
                my skills to be relevant and employable as well as gaining skills I can use outside the corporate world.
            </p><br>
            <p>Shortly I am aiming at giving back to my community by teaching young kids coding
                while introducing them to the technology world and helping them build confidence in themselves.
                I believe this will help reduce poverty and unemployment as technology is the current and 
                future.
            </p><br>
            <p>I have included my resume as well for more details below.</p><br>
