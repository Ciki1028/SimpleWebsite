            <p> I am currently at Capitec Bank as an employee and was lucky to receive the learnership for Java programming.
                I have been persuing a degree in Mathematics and Statistics while receiving this opportunity to do programming.
                My goal is to obtain this learnership qualification and go back to complete my degree,
                with the aim of becoming a Data Scientist.
            </p>
            <p>In the near future I am aiming at giving back to my community by teaching young kids coding,
                while introducing them to the technology world and helping them build confidence in themselves.
                I believe this will help reduce the poverty and unemployment as technology is the current and 
                future.
            </p>
